# JavaScript_Stenography_Functions
## Disclaimer, to avoid plagarism, I have not written these 3 functions. These were generated by ChatGPT, I plan to add some more advanced functions that I wrote myself when my JavaScript improves. My main specialty is Python.

Basic Stenography in JavaScript
At the moment, this repository has 3 JavaScript functions to do stenography on .png files with no alpha channel and in RGB mode.
These functions should be used in a NodeJS terminal
<br /><br />
embed(path_to_file, message)<br />
decode(path_to_file)<br />
erase(path_to_file)<br />

I plan to add some more code later and this repo is a living repo.
Notes and URLs will be added to aid the reader in learning about stenography with JavaScript.

The purpose of this repository is to both provide useful functions, and to teach coders about stenography.

# Release Notes
The (PNG + RGB + Image Channels == 3) test worked!
Tested on NodeJS v10.24.0, passed
The code was tested on the following image on this URL: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/PNG_Test.png
